# Task 3 – Exploratory Data Analysis Report

## What is EDA?
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of analyzing datasets visually and statistically to understand patterns, trends, and relationships.

## Key Visualizations & Insights

### 1. Histograms
Used to understand the distribution of numerical features such as petal length and sepal width in the Iris dataset.

### 2. Count Plots
Used for categorical features like content type (Movie/TV Show) in the Netflix dataset.

### 3. Box Plots
Helped identify outliers in numerical features.

### 4. Correlation Heatmap
Showed relationships between numerical variables and helped detect multicollinearity.

## Important Features
- Iris: Petal length and petal width are most important for species prediction.
- Netflix: Release year and rating show patterns in content production.

## Summary
EDA helped understand data behavior, detect outliers, and identify important features for modeling.
